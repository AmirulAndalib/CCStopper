## Known Issues
> There are more issues in the [issues](https://github.com/eaaasun/CCStopper/issues) section; these are just the most common ones.

**Issue:** Error message: `The execution of scripts is disabled on this system. Please see "Get-Help about_signing" for more details.` or selecting the "Genuine Checker" patch gives no results.

Fix: Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in an administrator powershell window, or manually execute the `StopProcesses.ps1` script in the scripts folder once (you can use CCStopper running the script for the first time manually). [Thanks /u/getblownaparte for bringing this issue up](https://www.reddit.com/user/getblownaparte/)

---

**Issue:** Error message: `The argument '.\scripts\StopProcesses.ps1' to the -File parameter does not exist. Provide the path to an existing file as an argument to the -File parameter.` and no apps are closed.

**Fix:** Update to the latest version of the script.
