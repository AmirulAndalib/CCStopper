### Alternate Distributions/Modifications
> I cannot offer any support for CCStopper unless it's a release from this repository.

I have no problems with this and enjoy seeing what people do with my code! Please make sure that your fork complies with this repository's license, and that the user knows it's a fork of CCStopper. Also, if you make any improvements, please consider making a pull request!

### Adding Entries to Hosts Blocklist
The `data` branch of CCStopper contains a `hosts.txt` file that has a list of addresses that CCStopper will block. If you think an address from adobe should be blocked, open a pull request with the address added to the bottom of the list. Also state why the address should be added to the hosts block.
